Welcome to my **React Training Repository**, where I document and build projects while learning React from scratch. This repo is a reflection of my daily progress, code practice, and applied understanding of core React concepts.

## 📅 30-Day React Training Plan

Each day focuses on a specific concept with hands-on demos, small projects, and learning summaries. The goal is to gain practical experience while building a strong foundation in React.
