## 🧩 What I Built  

### ✅ 1. Formik Form Handling

- Simplifies form state management.

- Handles submission and field-level errors automatically.

### ✅ 2. Yup Validation Schema

- Enforces validation rules:

- Full Name must be at least 3 characters.

- Email must follow valid email format.

- Password must be at least 6 characters.

- Confirm Password must match Password.

### ✅ 3. Error and Success Feedback

- ErrorMessage component displays validation errors.

- Shows success message ("✅ Registered Successfully") after form submission.

### ✅ 4. Reset and Feedback Flow

- Form resets after submission.

- Success message disappears after 3 seconds using useState.

🧠 **Key Learnings**  

- Formik removes boilerplate by managing form state, validation, and submission.

- Yup integrates seamlessly with Formik for schema-based validation.

- Real-time error handling improves user experience.

- Managing a temporary success message with useState makes UI more engaging.
