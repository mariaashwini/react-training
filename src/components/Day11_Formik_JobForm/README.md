## 🧩 What I Built  

### ✅ 1. JobForm Component  
- Created `JobForm.js` with Formik.  
- Fields include: **title, company, description, location, status, isRemote**.  
- Validation ensures all required fields are filled.  

### ✅ 2. Validation & Error Messages  
- Custom validation function highlights missing inputs.  
- Displays error messages below each field using `ErrorMessage`.  

### ✅ 3. Form Submission  
- On submit, form values are logged to the console.  
- Shows a temporary **success message** ✅ "Job Added".  
- Form resets after submission.  

### ✅ 4. Styling with CSS  
- `JobForm.css` styles the form with a **card-like layout**.  
- Added hover effects, focus styles, and a styled checkbox for better UX.
